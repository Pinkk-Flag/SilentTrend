This is 'SilentTrend', a tool that curates COT data to usable and actionable steps for trading.

### What is it?

COT data, or the *Commitment of Traders**, is data given by the US government from many different exchanges, e.g.,CME, CBOE, CBOT, etc. However, the data it is given is often very cluttered and hard to decipher. On top of that, it is hard to know what you want to do **with** that data.
